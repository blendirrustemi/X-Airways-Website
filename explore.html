                while people travel to Paris to see the Louvre, climb the Eiffel Tower, or see Notre-Dame, the real
                magic is found in the streets. Here, the ins and outs of daily life play out — chic women on bikes pedal
                their children to school, artists post up in cafés with a notebook, and both young and old line up
                morning and evening for a fresh baguette from the neighborhood boulangerie.</p>

                Europe. The five villages of Fira, Oia, Imerovigli, Firostefani, and Akrotiri sit atop the caldera and
                offer spectacular views into the crater created from a 16th-century BC volcanic eruption. What remains
                is an incredible sight and a magical setting for island hikes, infinity pools, luxury hotels, clifftop
                wineries, and dreamy sunset dinners.</p> <!-- A paragraph with info about the island of Santorini -->

                white sandy beaches, great surf, and luxury holiday resorts, which are clustered along the western
                shoreline. While the southern coast is somewhat developed, the heart of Barbados is made up of lush
                hillsides and plantations with a strong colonial heritage.</p>

            <p id="resize1">Surrounded by the hills of central Honshu, Kyoto is one of Japan's largest cities. It's also
                the educational hub of western Japan and boasts several universities and higher educational
                establishments. Although one of Japan's great tourist destinations, it is famous for having preserved
                much of the atmosphere of the past, having been the only major Japanese city to escape the devastation
                of WWII. </p> <!-- A paragraph with info about the city of Kyoto -->

                15 miles off the coast of Tanzania in East Africa. Unguja, commonly called Zanzibar, is the largest
                island, and it's where most visitors spend their time. Zanzibar is also known as the Spice Islands, and
                has been a major source of the world's supply of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper for
                centuries.</p> <!-- A paragraph with info about the island of Zanzibar -->
