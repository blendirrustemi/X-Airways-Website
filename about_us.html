                <p>In commercial air travel, particularly in airliners, cabins may be divided into several parts. These
                    can include travel class sections in medium and large aircraft, areas for flight attendants, the
                    galley, and storage for in-flight service. Seats are mostly arranged in rows and aisles. The higher
                    the travel class, the more space is provided. Cabins of the different travel classes are often
                    divided by curtains, sometimes called class dividers. Passengers are not usually allowed to visit
                    higher travel class cabins in commercial flights.</p>

                <h2>First Class</h2>
                <p>The first class section of an airplane is the class with the best service, and it is typically the
                    highest priced. The services offered are superior to those in business class, and they are available
                    on only a small number of long flights.</p>
                <h2>Premium Economy Class</h2>
                <p>Premium Economy class is a travel class offered by some airlines in order to provide a better flying
                    experience to the economy traveler, but for much less money than business class. It is often limited
                    to a few extras such as more legroom, as well as complimentary food and drinks</p>

                <h2>Business Class</h2>
                <p>Business class is more expensive, but it also offers more amenities to travelers than the classes
                    below it. These may include better food, wider entertainment options, more comfortable seats with
                    more room to recline and more legroom, among others.</p>
                <h2>Economy Class</h2>
                <p>Economy class is the airline travel class with the lowest ticket price, as the level of comfort is
                    lower than that of the other classes. This class is primarily characterized by the short distance
                    between each seat, and a smaller variety of food and entertainment.</p>
